# workout-tracker

## Description
A site that keeps all your workouts in one place. Whether you want to see your most recent workout or your previous ones, you can view it all. Add different exercises to the workouts, past or present, where the name, type and duration of the exercise is required and set optional attributes like distance, weight (being lifted), reps and sets.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track all my workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout. I should at minimum be able to track the name, type and duration of an exercise but have the option to add the distance traveled for cardio, weight being lifted, and the number of sets and reps. 

## Installation
The app can be used through the deployed site above, but if you want to clone the repo, the application requires Node.js and MongoDB to be installed. 
1. Check if Node.js is installed by entering `node --version` into the command line. If it is installed, a version number should be displayed. 
   - If not, it can be [downloaded from their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then check if it was installed properly by performing `node --version` 
2. If the command `mongod` or `mongo` is not recognised in the command line, MongoDB has not been installed. [Follow the guides here for your OS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
3. Run `npm install` in the command line to install all dependencies
4. To run locally, run `node server` in the command line and then open localhost:3000 in your browser
